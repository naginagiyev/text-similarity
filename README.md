# text-similarity
The algorithm that is developed by me to find the similarity between words.
When you open the code, you'll see string1 and string2. When you run the code, the program show to the similarity between string1 and string2 with percentage.
This code does not take into account the meaning of the words. It checks similarity based on the characters that strings contain.
One bad side of the code is, when you type two strings with same symbols but different replacements. It will give the similarity as 100% (like "dog" and "gdo").
